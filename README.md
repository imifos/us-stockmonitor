# USSM - Ultra-Simple Stock Monitor

Small afternoon-project'ish Python script that monitors a list of stock quotes. Displays 5y,2y and 3mo price history, auto-circles over all quotes every 15 seconds, downloads the data from YAHOO every hour. Uses the tkinter (Tk interface), Matplotlib and the yahooquery package, which have to be installed. Configuration at the top of the script itself.
